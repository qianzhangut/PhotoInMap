# PhotoInMap 

This project provides a local, customized and private map that you can mark the places you have been to and embed a photo taken at that place. You can share these memory with families, friends, and loved ones. To use, you need to install exifread
and folium:
exifread extracts location infomation from photos

    pip3 install exifead
folium enables the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations

    pip3 install folium

Here is an example of a few CN Tower photos[1] (https://wallpapercave.com/). I embeded random location and datetime information 2](https://www.thexifer.net/#exif-general) into these photos[, that's why you see some photos are located in the lake.
